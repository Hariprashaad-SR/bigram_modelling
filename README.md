# Bigram Modelling

Bigram language modeling is a type of probabilistic language model that predicts the probability of a word given the previous word. In this model, the probability of a word depends only on the previous word, which makes it a first-order Markov model. This can be useful for tasks like text generation, where the model predicts the next word in a sequence based on the previous word.
